## Problem Set 01:  Hello World

__Due 09-13 (7 days)__

These sketches you will get familiar with HTML and CSS. We will look at the __design and construction__ of these web pages.  To encourage divergent and exploratory thinking, you can present _up to three solutions_. We will also be looking at the source of these pages. Because we are using CSS, you should reuse the same HTML to produce the three sketches.

For this assignment you are expressly forbidden to use Javascript.

These exercises are designed to be approachable for beginners. Because we have a diverse classroom, learners with more experience are expected to:
* Assist, coach, and encourage first time practitioners.
* Go beyond the the minimum expectations.
* Provide inspiring and exemplar solutions.
* Take more risks, look for counter-examples & edge-cases, and _fail in public_.
* Provide a written summary or explainer of your work, especially if you are using techniques or topics we haven't gone over in class.
* Include great navigation between pages of your problem set.

### ps-02
* `2016-SWC/ps-02/index.html`.
  * Include your name, the date, and the problem set number (`ps-02`).
  * Include links to __each__ of the exercises below.
  * Style this index page using CSS.
  * 15 points.

#### a: (1-3) 'profile cards':
These pages should be like business cards, brief personal profiles, or pokeymon cards.  If you are not comfortable making a card for yourself, feel free to choose a fictional character.
* Each page should include:
  * An image tag. A drawing or photo of the subject.
  * A heading tag. The headline: e.g. 'Noah Paessel'
  * A smaller headline tag. The secondary heading. e.g: 'Coach'
  * A small paragraph of text. Possibly 1 - 4 sentences, or contact information, or a table or chart of special abilities.

#### b: (1-3) Compositions of 3 squares:
Create web sketches consisting of exactly three squares. Work in monochrome. The design markup of these pages should be composed empty `<div>` tags. You can include optional navigational or informational markup, but it should be well considered, and not detract from the composition.

#### c: (1-3) Quiet & Loud:
Create the loudest (or quietest) web page you can, in monochrome. Use clean, minimal markup. What would a subliminal page look like? A page with a hidden message?

#### d: (optional) Tag explainer:
Create a web page that demonstrates and explains an unusual HTML tag.

#### For stretchers:
* Above pages should be easy to navigate. 
* Pages should look good on a multitude of devices. 
* Bring something new or surprising to the table.
* Go down a rabbit hole, and be prepared to talk about it.
