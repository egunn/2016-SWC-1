## Git wrapup:
* Did anyone make a few repositories?
* Did anyone make multiple commits?
* Did anyone experiment with making branches?

### Critical git concepts & terms:
* Git is a source control tool.
* Git saves versions of your project.
* Use `git commit` to make changes part of the permanent record.
* Use `git status` to see if you have 'dirty' files.
* Use `git log` to review your history.
* Git can be used to `push` or `pull` changes from remote locations. (like github)
* Pictures and demo from github desktop client.
* Alternate git client: [source tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

### More git concepts & ideas:
* historic versions of your project have a `sha1` label.
* You can ignore some files. such as '.DS_Store'
  * lets try removing it from github, and then ignoreing it.
* you can use `git ceckout <sha1>` to time-travel to specific commits.
* you can use `git checkout -b` to create a new branch.
* you can include change from one branch into another using `git merge`
* pictures and demo

### Git magic:
* `git rebase <commit>`
* `git reset <commit>`

### Where to go for help:
* [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* [slack](https://2016-swc.slack.com/messages/general/)
* google

### Static site hosting:
We can easily deploy static websites using github pages. There are other free / easy web publishing platforms too:
* Dropbox.
* [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com) (drag and drop)
* [Surge](https://surge.sh/) (node)
* [Figroll](https://www.figroll.io/)
* Heroku, Firebase, &etc. 
  
### The web: HTML and CSS:
* WE CANT DO THIS. ITS TOO MUCH.
* Ommission of JavaScript
* Copy and paste
* Open [a page in Chrome](https://knowuh.github.io/2016-SWC/).  
  * View Source.
  * Copy and paste made the web explode.
  * Echos of DIY zine culture.
  * View developer tools.
* Quick history (slides).
* HTML Documentation from the Mozilla Developer Network
  * [Mozilla guide HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
   [introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction)
  * [reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference)

#### A sample document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>title</title>
    <meta name="author" content="name">
    <meta name="description" content="description here">
    <meta name="keywords" content="keywords,here">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/stylesheet.css" type="text/css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script1.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="../img/favicon-32x32.png" alt="favicon" />
    <h1> This is a heading </h1>
    <div class='main-content' id='body1'>
      <p class='lead'> First paragraph. </p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

* Experiment with the 'fault tolerant' nature of HTML.
* Use [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
* Check with the browser.
* Q: Whats the problem with this?  Why does HTML suck?
