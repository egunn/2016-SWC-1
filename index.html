<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Code sketching is a methodology for quickly exploring visual ideas by writing software. Encoding design decisions in software forces us to consider visual design from a new angle. Designers who learn to enjoy writing code will think differently about their process. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript students will develop a low-friction design processes that enables rapid prototyping and iteration. Through a series of exercises exploring gestalt principles of design, students will achieve a measure of code fluency and intuition. Students will use computation to explore large parameter spaces, guide stochastic digital mark-making, and generate new visual forms. No prior programming experience is assumed for this studio.</p>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>Students will leave this course knowing how to create and publish rich interactive data experiences on a schedule. They will be comfortable sketching and presenting rough ideas for feedback. They will favor an iterative design process to refine ideas and meet deadlines. Students will be able to articulate design  decisions made during project planning meetings.</p>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>Over the course of 14 weeks each student will also lead a short critique on a data design they found in the wild. We use these show and tell sessions to hone our communication skills and to foster new ideas. In these presentations, students should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate the design to the class, discuss how it works, and who made it.</li>
<li>Tell us what is unique or inspirational about the work.</li>
<li>Suggest how the work could be improved.</li>
<li>Contextualize the design by identifying other designs of precedence or influence.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grading-">Grading:</h3>
<p>Students will show continuous improvement in their ability to execute and defend design solutions.</p>
<p>The grading system follows the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/registrar/gradingsystem.html">University Policies</a>.</p>
<h5 id="criteria-">Criteria:</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>70% Project work – presentation, and defense:</strong> We evaluate designs based on clarity, efficiency, originality, and emotional impact. Work should be grounded in data, informed by critical thinking, guided by cognitive principles, and refined on the basis of feedback given in class. The work should communicate on its own, but students must defend the decisions made in their process.</li>
<li><p><strong>20% class participation:</strong> The studio is a community. Modern design challenges require collaboration and communication. Students should offer respectful and insightful design critique. Students must offer sophisticated and challenging ideas in design charettes. We expect students in this studio ro challenge and elevate each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>10% peer evaluation:</strong> Peer evaluation is meaningful. Students will evaluate each others work. We will account for this evaluation in the grading process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="integrity">Integrity</h5>
<p>Students will abide by Northeastern University’s <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academicintegrity/">Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>
<h5 id="attendance">Attendance</h5>
<p>Students are expected to attend all classes. Absence for health or personal reasons should be communicated to the lecturer. Tardiness and unexcused absences will impact student grades.</p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
<ol>
<li><code>Jan 11</code> <strong><a href="./01/">Orientation</a>:</strong> Introductions, overview, agreement, processes. Publishing workflow using a text editor, HTML, CSS, and git.</li>
<li><code>Jan 25</code> <strong><a href="./02/">Drawing with code</a>:</strong> Introduction to key programming concepts using JavaScript and Processing. We learn to make digital marks and cover: variables, lists, conditionals, loops, and functions. <em>Presentation by Erica</em>.</li>
<li><code>Feb  1</code> <strong><a href="./03/">Parametric design</a>:</strong> We look at abstraction and how we can express variables in graphic dimensions using D3 and SVG. We review the interaction design mantra and gestalt principles along the way.</li>
<li><code>Feb  8</code> <strong><a href="./04/">Data</a>:</strong> Snow Day. Class was cancelled but we met on Slack, and carried on.</li>
<li><code>Feb 22</code> <strong><a href="./05/">Projects in Social Visualization</a>:</strong> A review of significant works within our domain. We conduct a design lab and charette for project proposals. <em>Presentations from Lucy</em>.</li>
<li><code>Feb 29</code> <strong><a href="./06/">Project proposals</a>:</strong> Students present their proposals and mockups for initial review. We refine them in class. <em>Presentations from Lorzenzo, Sever, Cara</em>.</li>
<li><code>Mar 14</code> <strong><a href="./07/">Challenges</a>:</strong> Students discuss the greatest challenges they face in their chosen project. We address technical fears and challenges together in the class, and begin working on our prototypes. <em>Presentations from June and Andrew</em>.</li>
<li><code>Mar 21</code> <strong><a href="./08">Work</a>:</strong> Studio work. Solving problems. Making Prototypes. <em>Presentations from Kimi and Jiani</em>.</li>
<li><code>Mar 28</code> <strong>★ <a href="./09">Midterm review</a>:</strong> Students present prototypes of their final projects for review. Key technical challenges should be addressed or hidden by means of fakery, so we can focus on the visual design in critique.</li>
<li><code>Apr  4</code> <strong><a href="./10">Blockers and words of advice</a>:</strong> A last call to mitigate any remaining technical design challenges that threaten the final project. <em>Presentations from Jessie and Patric</em>.</li>
<li><code>Apr 11</code> <strong><a href="./11">Refinement</a>:</strong> At this point no substantial changes should be happening. We are only tightening the presentation of the designs. A discussion about our mutual expectations. <em>Presentation from Ryan, Navi, and Lia</em>.</li>
<li><code>Apr 25</code> <strong><a href="./12/">★ Final project presentations</a> !</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="weekly-structure">Weekly Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>5:30 – 6:20</code> <strong>Critique &amp; Charette</strong>. Students present work from previous week at the start of the class. Students will critique the formal elements of the design, visual impact, legibility, and context of the work shown. Presenters will explain their intentions and process. Reviewers suggest next steps for strengthening, extending, or rethinking the design. Presenters restate the comments and suggestions that most resonated with them.</li>
<li><code>6:20 - 6:30</code> <strong>Student presentation</strong>. Each week a student will present an interactive data visualization to the class, and lead an design analysis.</li>
<li><code>6:30 - 6:40</code> <strong>Break</strong>.</li>
<li><code>6:40 - 7:15</code> <strong>Lecture</strong>.  We introduce new technical material, covering topics required to complete projects like consuming APIs.</li>
<li><code>7:15 – 8:00</code> <strong>Work together</strong>. We work together to complete code that addresses our technical needs. This code is shared on github, and can be used by student teams as a launching point for their work.</li>
<li><code>8:00 - 8:10</code> <strong>Break</strong>.</li>
<li><code>8:10 - 9:00</code> <strong>Work</strong>. Students work alone or in small groups on capstone project or weekly challenges. This is a great time for students to help each other, or ask me for help.</li>
