To show how events work, and how we can update the contents of our web page in reaction to events. Start by adding text to a document logging when events happen. Then maybe draw stuff on a canvas when things happen.
- setTimeout
- setInterval
- animation frame
- click handling
- mouse handling
- keyboard handling

#### Dom and Events:
- `document.getElementByID();`
