# Class 08 – 2016-11-01: Javascript: Canvas Simulations & emergent behavior

## New problem set [ps-08](ps-08.html)

More working together today.
Start thinking about your Final projects.
Something small that you can accomplish in 2-3 weeks.


## Review problem set:  5:45 – 6:50 
* Review [ps-07](../07/ps-07.html) 


## Questions about the reading? 6:50 - 7:00


## State of 2016-SWC  7:00 – 7:15

## Odds & Ends: 7:15 – 7:30
- jQuery
    - What is it?
    - Why is it useful?
    - How do I use it?
        - Include it as a resource in your HTML `<script>` tags. 
        See a simple [example](jquery-sample.html)
    - Where can I learn more?
        - [jQuery website](https://jquery.com/)
        - [how jQuery works](http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/)
        - [Overview](http://learn.jquery.com/)
        - [jQuery API](http://api.jquery.com/)
- 'Exporting' functions via global namespace. Reusing code.
- `setTimeout`
- `setInterval`
- `requestAnimationFrame`
- Array
    - Define an array to represent the screen in two ways
    - Look into an array
    - Iterate through an array


### Look at "Shepherding random numbers" (deluxe random walking)

### Random Walkers exemplars 
- [Thread](https://twitter.com/c0dew3aver/status/793395297061707776)
- [Recursion Toy](http://soulwire.co.uk/experiments/recursion-toy/)


### A simple simulation 'random walk'  in code-pen 7:50 - 8:45
This is related to Today's problem set [Simulation](./ps-08). This is one of the simplest simulations. A line is created by the meandering path of dot as it moves over time.

- Phase 0: Develop the initial state together ~5 min.
    - A dot on the screen
    - A simple animation?
- Phase 1: Move the dot over time.
- Phase 2: What happens when we reach an edge?
- Phase 3: Exploration. Can you make this more interesting?
