# Problem set guidelines:

I will assign weekly problem sets. These exercises and design challenges will be started in class and are due the following week. Solutions to problem sets will web pages published via [github](http://github.com) in your repository named `2016-SWC`. Solutions will be reviewed in class on a (~ 1024 x 768) Chrome browser. The URL to the solution set should be `http://<github-username>.github.io/2016-SWC/ps-number/index.html` e.g.: `http://knowuh.github.io/2016-SWC/01/index.html`.

Solutions set pages should include the following information:

* Your name
* The date, in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`
* The problem set number, in the form of `PS-XX-x`, e.g.: `PS-01-a`

Solutions will be critiqued in class. They may be sketches, but they should be 'buttoned up' for presentation. Together we will discuss the solution's approach, process, and form.

## Tips:

* URLS, filenames, & paths are all *case sensitive*. Pay attention to that.
* Produce a series of thumbnail sketches for several ideas on paper first.
* Focus first on landscape orientation. Then consider different browser size / aspect ratios.
* Always submit *something*.
* Credit all source material and inspiration.
