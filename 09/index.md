# Class 09 – 2016-11-08: Javascript: Canvas simulation II (and animation)

## New problem set [ps-09](ps-09.html)



## Review problem set:  5:45 – 6:30 
* Review [ps-08](../08/ps-08.html) 


## Reading:  Higher Order Functions. 6:30 - 7:00
If you don't feel confused I am inclined to think you are. We will cover simple for-each example in class.


## Odds & Ends: 7:00 – 7:30
- Recursive functions, [L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) and [tree demo](./tree.html)
- Tweening
    - What is it?
      - [example tween animation](./animation.html)
    - Why is it useful?
    - How can I use it?
      -  Use a library like [tweenjs](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/)
 
### Look at "Shepherding random numbers part II" (deluxe random walking)  7:30 - 7:45
[http://inconvergent.net/shepherding-random-grids/](http://inconvergent.net/shepherding-random-grids/)                                

### (maybe) Look at "Shepherding randome growth (part III)" [http://inconvergent.net/shepherding-random-growth/](http://inconvergent.net/shepherding-random-growth/)

### Multiple walkers in code-pen 7:45 - 8:45
This is related to Today's problem set [Simulation-2](./ps-09.html). In this weeks problem set we will expand upon last weeks random walk by using multiple walkers.

- Phase 0: Develop the initial state together ~10 min.
    - Some dots on the screen
- Phase 1: Move the dots over time.
- Phase 2: What happens when we reach an edge?
- Phase 3: Exploration. Can you make this more interesting?
